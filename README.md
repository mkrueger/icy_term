## Requires

IcyTerm needs a graphics card that can can do opengl 3.3+.
(It's the 2010 version but some people have problems starting)

If it doesn't run check if graphics card drivers are up to date.

On Windows:
opengl32.dll
And VCRUNTIME140.dll is required. Usually these two are installed and it should run out of the box. If you can run any game with 3D graphics it should just work.

# History

I had an own BBS back in the 90'. When I started rust I searched a project and some days earlier I spoke with my wife about the good old days, PCBoard and then I got the idea to improve the PPL decompiler we used these days.
That was my first project and it was successful (https://github.com/mkrueger/PPLEngine).
Around that time I learned that there are still BBSes in the internet and I started to update my old ansi drawing tool (MysticDraw) however I lost a bit track because of the gtk4 bindings. It's very difficult to write even a mid sized UI application with these.

First I tried to ressurect my old ansi drawing tool (Mystic Draw) using gtk4 bindings. But they didn't really suit my needs.
Tried Druid/Egui/Iced and decided to do a smaller project that relies on an ansi engine too.

So I decided to do a terminal program. After a first implementation with iced (cool library, can recommend) I switched to egui because I needed an opengl control and the support in iced for that was lacking at that point of time.

So this was more of a test project for the ansi engine & writing rust UI apps but it got a bit larger than I thought and now IcyTerm is a fully featured terminal app for BBSes.
