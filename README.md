# History

I had an own BBS back in the 90'. When I started rust I searched a project and some days earlier I spoke with my wife about the good old days, PCBoard and then I got the idea to improve the PPL decompiler we used these days.
That was my first project and it was successful (https://github.com/mkrueger/PPLEngine).
Around that time I learned that there are still BBSes in the internet and I started to update my old ansi drawing tool (MysticDraw) however I lost a bit track because of the gtk4 bindings. It's very difficult to write even a mid sized UI application with these.

First I tried to ressurect my old ansi drawing tool (Mystic Draw) using gtk4 bindings. But they didn't really suit my needs.
Tried Druid/Egui/Iced and decided to do a smaller project that relies on an ansi engine too.

So I decided to do a terminal program. After a first implementation with iced (cool library, can recommend) I switched to egui because I needed an opengl control and the support in iced for that was lacking at that point of time.

So this was more of a test project for the ansi engine & writing rust UI apps but it got a bit larger than I thought and now IcyTerm is a fully featured terminal app for BBSes.
